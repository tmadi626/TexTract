# TexTract
Image Processing Project Program.
Allows for word extraction from Images.

To run the app:

- Need to download [tesseract] first.

- For Windows 64bit, you can do that by running the file [tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.1.20230401] or 
  through this link [https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.1.20230401.exe].

- For Mac, you can run this command: `brew install tesseract`

- You will be asked for the location of tesseract later so take note of its path.

- After that, run a terminal in the path where the python program is.

- run `python3 main.py`

- You will be asked to select the tesseract.exe file so navigate to its path 
  for ex: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR and select tesseract.exe.
